# BI-Exam-Student-Performance

## Problem Formulation
### Foundation of a business case and problem statement 
#### 1. At this stage you brainstorm, browse sources of inspiration and information, collect ideas and discuss business or social domains, where BI and AI can bring a value.
Ideas: Rape cases in India, “Party Forecast” - predicting when the club is lit, Hate Crimes 2017-2025, traffic accidents, global age, airline flight delays, data scientist salaries and student performance.

#### 2. Choose one of your ideas and define context, purpose, research questions, and hypotheses for a BI problem statement. Write a brief annotation of your project, in about four sentences, explaining: 
#### Which challenge you would like to address? 
#### Why is this challenge important or interesting research goal? 
#### What is the expected solution your project would provide? 
#### What would be the positive impact of the solution, which category of users could benefit from it?
We would like to address the challenge of why students have different academic performances. It is important to us, as we ourselves may have some factors that drag our own performance down. The expected solution would be to find the biggest factors that drag the individual students academic performance down. Students can benefit from the solution, as they can compare the factors found to their own lifestyle.
