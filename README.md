#  BI-Exam-Student-Performance

###  Brainstorm
After exploring datasets on platforms like OpenML, Kaggle, and World Bank Data, we selected the **Student_Performance_Dataset** from OpenML.

It provides measurable information such as age, gender, study time, absences, and GPA. Our goal is to analyze which factors contribute to strong vs. poor school performance, and how these differ between male and female students.

###  Brief Annotation
This project addresses the challenge of identifying which measurable factors contribute to high or low academic performance among students. It also explores how these factors may affect boys and girls differently, and whether one group can benefit by adopting effective behaviors or support strategies from the other.

Using Business Intelligence tools, we will analyze the data and develop a model capable of estimating a student's GPA based on these key factors. The results will offer valuable insights for educators, counselors, and students, supporting more personalized and gender-sensitive strategies to improve academic outcomes.

###  Research Questions
1. Which factors (e.g., study time, absences, parental support) have the strongest correlation with students' GPA?  
2. Are there noticeable differences in performance-related factors between male and female students?  
3. Can we predict a studentâ€™s GPA based on their background and behavioral inputs?  
4. Does participation in extracurricular activities (e.g., sports, music, volunteering) impact GPA positively?

---

###  Hypotheses
1. Students who study more hours per week tend to have higher GPA scores.  
2. Absences are negatively correlated with academic performance.  
3. Female students generally have higher GPA scores than male students when controlling for other factors.  
4. Students receiving tutoring or high parental support perform better academically than those who do not.
