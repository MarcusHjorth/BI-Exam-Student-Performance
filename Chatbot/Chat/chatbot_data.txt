Brainstorm:
We explored datasets from OpenML and Kaggle and selected two:

- Student Performance Dataset (OpenML)
- Student Habits vs Academic Performance (Kaggle)

These datasets include:
- Study time
- Absences
- Parental education
- GPA or similar scores

The Kaggle set also covers behaviors like sleep and social media use.

Our goals:
- Compare the datasets
- See how habits influence grades
- Build a model to predict GPA from study time
- Create a chatbot to explain our results

Project Summary:
This project analyzes what affects school performance. Using real and simulated data, we explore habits like study time, absences, parental education, sleep, and social media.

Goal: Discover which habits impact grades the most and test if machine learning can predict student performance.

Hypotheses:
1. More study hours = higher GPA
2. More absences = lower GPA
3. Educated parents = better grades

Research Questions:
1. How do study time, absences, and parent education affect grades?
2. Do sleep and social media habits influence performance?
3. Can GPA be predicted from study time alone?
4. Do real vs. simulated datasets show the same trends?
5. Can a chatbot help explain which habits matter?
