Predicting Student GPA Using Linear Regression

Goal:
We want to predict a student's GPA based on weekly study time using a linear regression model. We used:
- Real dataset from OpenML
- Simulated dataset from Kaggle

Why Linear Regression?
- Simple and easy to interpret
- Shows the relationship between study time and GPA
- Serves as a strong baseline before trying more complex models

Steps Summary:

1. Load Cleaned Data:
- The data was pre-cleaned and stored in a folder.
- We explored the structure before modeling.

2. Align Datasets:
- Simulated study hours (daily) converted to weekly.
- Exam score scaled to GPA (0–4) using:
  GPA = (exam_score / 100) * 4

3. Combine Datasets:
- Combined both datasets into one for training and testing.

4. Explore the Data (EDA):
- Summary stats revealed GPA column had mixed scales.
- Fixed by scaling exam scores to GPA format.
- Visualized GPA distribution, study time, and scatter plot.

5. Train/Test Split:
- 70% data used for training, 30% for testing.
- Feature: StudyTimeWeekly
- Target: GPA

6. Train & Evaluate:
- Model used linear regression
- Performance:
  - R² Score ≈ 0.242 (explains 24% of variation)
  - RMSE ≈ 0.83 (average error)

Conclusion:
- Study time alone is not enough to predict GPA accurately
- GPA prediction needs more features

Model Improvement:
Added:
- Absences
- Parental Education

New Results:
- Higher R²
- Lower RMSE

Final Takeaway:
Better models need more context. Study time helps, but multiple features lead to more accurate GPA predictions.
