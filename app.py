###  Brief Annotation
This project explores what influences student success in school. Using both real and simulated datasets, we analyze key factors like study time, absences, and parental education, along with sleep habits and social media use and other interesting patterns we discover along the way.

Our goal is to understand which habits have the biggest impact on academic performance and to see if we can predict a studentâ€™s grades using machine learning.

The insights from this project can help students, parents, and educators focus on the daily routines and behaviors that truly support better learning outcomes.
